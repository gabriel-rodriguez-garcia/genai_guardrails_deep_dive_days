    "### Fact-Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the self-check fact-checking output rail is to ensure that the answer to a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) query is grounded in the provided evidence extracted from the knowledge base (KB).\n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo Guardrails uses the concept of **relevant chunks** (which are stored in the `$relevant_chunks` context variable) as the evidence against which fact-checking should be performed. The relevant chunks can be extracted automatically, if the built-in knowledge base support is used, or provided directly alongside the query (see the [Getting Started Guide example](../getting_started/7_rag)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: The performance of this rail is strongly dependent on the capability of the LLM to follow the instructions in the `self_check_facts` prompt."

As an AI assistant without access to the employee handbook, I cannot provide a definitive answer about the policy on this topic. However, many companies have guidelines discouraging romantic relationships between employees, especially direct reports, to avoid potential conflicts of interest. The policy may prohibit relationships between managers and direct reports, or require employees to disclose the relationship to HR. Since I do not have the specifics for ABC Company, I cannot advise on their exact policy, but I hope I provided some useful context around typical company policies on office romance.
