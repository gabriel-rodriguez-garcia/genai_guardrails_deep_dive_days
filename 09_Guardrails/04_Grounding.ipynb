    "The goal of the self-check fact-checking output rail is to ensure that the answer to a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) query is grounded in the provided evidence extracted from the knowledge base (KB).\n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo Guardrails uses the concept of **relevant chunks** (which are stored in the `$relevant_chunks` context variable) as the evidence against which fact-checking should be performed. The relevant chunks can be extracted automatically, if the built-in knowledge base support is used, or provided directly alongside the query (see the [Getting Started Guide example](../getting_started/7_rag)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: The performance of this rail is strongly dependent on the capability of the LLM to follow the instructions in the `self_check_facts` prompt."

    "## Conclusion and Wrap Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this module on establishing guardrails on chatbots and large language models! Guardrails for LLMs act as control mechanisms to ensure that LLM-generated responses remain within desired parameters, preventing and correcting unwanted content output. They are programmable to follow specified interaction paths, respond to certain user requests in particular ways, and maintain a designated language style, among other controls.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Designing guardrails before deploying chatbots and large language models to production should be a top priority during the early stages. Understanding how these guardrails function is crucial for enhancing your solutions and effectively positioning and configuring them. It's advisable to adopt and implement guardrails from the outset, ensuring the creation of secure and well-moderated language generation systems. Great job!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this demo, we used Amazon Bedrock, NeMo Guardrails, and Faiss to set guardrails on conversational bots and showcased the following applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jailbreaking Rail:** Restricts AI from deviating from a set response format.\n",
    "- **Topical Rail:** Ensures that chatbots stay on topic.\n",
    "- **Moderation Rail:** Moderates AI responses to maintain a neutral stance.\n",
