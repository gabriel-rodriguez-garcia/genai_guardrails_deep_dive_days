    "## Topical Rail - Demo\n",
    "Developing chatbots that stay on topic can be challenging. The key is to build the bot to be knowledgeable about specific subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll look at some ways to keep a chatbot on topic, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constructing the chatbot knowledge to be focused on particular topics and conversations \n",
    "- Providing a quick overview of how to launch a chatbot with mechanisms to keep it on a single topic\n",
    "- Demonstrating dialogues that illustrate the chatbot sticking to certain subjects and avoiding others\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to guide the chatbot to stay on target when users ask questions, rather than letting the conversation drift aimlessly. By designing the chatbot well and giving it the right scopes of knowledge, we can create more useful and effective conversational agents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does NeMo Guardrails works for topical identification (in a nutshell)\n",
    "Topical rail ensures AI responses stay within the predefined topic, and prevents off-topic conversations that has no business value.\n",
    "1. As part of Guardrails configuration, you define different conversation flow and how Guardrails treat them.\n",
    "2. You provide example input texts for each flow.\n",
    "3. When the user sends text, Guardrails intercepts it, and tries to understand which flow it maps to (Embedding based similarity search vs each flow's examples texts). \n",
    "4. With the flow established Guardrails carries out the flow (e.g., let's the LLM respond, or replies back the conversation is off-topic)."
