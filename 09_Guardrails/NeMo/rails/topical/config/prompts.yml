      </current_conversation>

      Use the sample conversation, examples, and current conversation to write a reply for the bot.
      Make sure to pay close attention to the canonical form for what the bot should say (if applicable)!
      Only write the reply for the bot, and nothing else. Do not write the canonical form.
