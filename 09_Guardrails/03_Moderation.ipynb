    "### Moderation \n",
    "in the context of bots refers to a set of mechanisms or filters applied to ensure that the bot's responses and interactions remain appropriate, respectful, and free from offensive or harmful content. This may include screening responses for unethical content, blocking certain phrases, and managing improper behavior from users, such as provocative or insulting language. The goal is to maintain a positive and safe interaction environment between the bot and the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Bot Moderation Through Scenario Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a customer service bot on a website. Here's how moderation could work in a real-world scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Interaction**: A user uses offensive language while interacting with the bot.\n",
    "2. **First Strike**: The bot issues a warning to maintain a respectful tone.\n",
    "3. **Second Strike**: Upon continued offensive language, the \"Two Strikes\" rule triggers, ending the conversation or temporarily banning the user from further interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this scenario, we observe how moderation mechanisms help in maintaining a conducive interaction environment, ensuring that the conversation remains respectful and within defined ethical boundaries.\n",

    "## Conclusion and Wrap Up\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this module on establishing guardrails on chatbots and large language models! Guardrails for LLMs act as control mechanisms to ensure that LLM-generated responses remain within desired parameters, preventing and correcting unwanted content output. They are programmable to follow specified interaction paths, respond to certain user requests in particular ways, and maintain a designated language style, among other controls.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Designing guardrails before deploying chatbots and large language models to production should be a top priority during the early stages. Understanding how these guardrails function is crucial for enhancing your solutions and effectively positioning and configuring them. It's advisable to adopt and implement guardrails from the outset, ensuring the creation of secure and well-moderated language generation systems. Great job!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this demo, we used Amazon Bedrock, NeMo Guardrails, and Faiss to set guardrails on conversational bots and showcased the following applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jailbreaking Rail:** Restricts AI from deviating from a set response format.\n",
    "- **Topical Rail:** Ensures that chatbots stay on topic.\n",
    "- **Moderation Rail:** Moderates AI responses to maintain a neutral stance.\n",
