    "### Moderation \n",
    "in the context of bots refers to a set of mechanisms or filters applied to ensure that the bot's responses and interactions remain appropriate, respectful, and free from offensive or harmful content. This may include screening responses for unethical content, blocking certain phrases, and managing improper behavior from users, such as provocative or insulting language. The goal is to maintain a positive and safe interaction environment between the bot and the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding Bot Moderation Through Scenario Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a customer service bot on a website. Here's how moderation could work in a real-world scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Interaction**: A user uses offensive language while interacting with the bot.\n",
    "2. **First Strike**: The bot issues a warning to maintain a respectful tone.\n",
    "3. **Second Strike**: Upon continued offensive language, the \"Two Strikes\" rule triggers, ending the conversation or temporarily banning the user from further interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this scenario, we observe how moderation mechanisms help in maintaining a conducive interaction environment, ensuring that the conversation remains respectful and within defined ethical boundaries.\n",

By using a SageMaker project, teams of data scientists and developers can work together on ML business problems. SageMaker projects use MLOps templates that automate the model building and deployment pipelines using CI/CD.
